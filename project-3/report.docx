Some of the obstacles I encounter were coming up with unique ways to address the edge cases. This was important for me because I usually would ignore the edge cases and assume the index works. I also learned to use the size rather than a normal int because this help with if theres multiple batches.

A description of the design of your program. You should use pseudocode in this
description where it clarifies the presentation pseudocode is implementing into the comment and designs for example.
// Counts passes and defects
// Invalidates leading zeros
// Reset for each batch 
I explain the edge cases and why I did what I did in the function to make sure the input only allows specific details and they add up properly.
Test results:
Pass test result(s) returns Q2p1d1 //prove if it works for basic input
isValidQC returns true
passQC returns 1
defectQC returns 1
totalQC returns 2
batches returns 1 //works
Q19p10d9 – double digit
isValidQC returns true
passQC returns 10
defectQC returns 9
totalQC returns 19
batches returns 1//works

Pass test result(s) returns Q2p1d1Q3p1d2//incase theres two of them
isValidQC returns true
passQC returns 2
defectQC returns 3
totalQC returns 5
batches returns -1
Q2p1d1Q3p1d1//doesn’t add up
isValidQC returns false
passQC returns -1
defectQC returns -1
totalQC returns -1
batches returns -1
